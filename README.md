## Chess

Port the terminal-based Chess program to Android: a chess app that lets two people play chess with each other on the phone. You need to carry over all the functionality from the Chess project, and implement some other new functionality.

### Playing chess (120 pts)

-  **30 pts** Two humans can use your app to play a game of Chess - this is all the functionality from the Chess assignment.
-  **20 pts** Your app must draw the board with icons for the pieces, and correctly shaded squares.
-  **20 pts** Players must move their pieces using touch input - either dragging a piece or touching first the piece's original square and then its destination.
-  **10 pts** Provide an 'undo' function that will undo the last move (but no farther).
-  **10 pts** Provide an 'AI' button that will choose a move for the current player. Choosing randomly from the set of legal moves is sufficient.
-  **20 pts** Provide functional 'draw' and 'resign' buttons.
-  **10 pts** When the game is over, report the outcome.

### Recording games (50 pts)

-  **20 pts** Record all games as they're being played.
-  **10 pts** At the conclusion of a game, offer to store it and prompt the user for a game title.
-  **20 pts** List all recorded games, sorted by both date and by title (user can select which view to choose).

### Game playback (30 pts)

A function that allows the user to play a selected recorded game. The selected game should be playable one move at a time, per player. The user of the app will click each time they want to see the next move (i.e. the moves are not auto-animated.)
